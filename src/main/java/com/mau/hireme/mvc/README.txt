This package includes:
- the ui's controller, mainly there just to manage the simple happy/health page of the microservice together with the Thymeleaf "home.html" template.
- the endpoints (api package)

The api package is structured in various subpackages based on the assumption that in future the micro-service may need to become multi-protocol or offer an open/premium service.
