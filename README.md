# Shakespeare's Pokemons
This micro-service provides an API that allows to get the Shakespearean description of a Pokemon.  
It relies on two back-end APIs:
* PokeAPI: http://pokeapi.co
* Shakespeare translator: http://funtranslations.com/api/shakespeare  

It provides (if running on localhost:5000):
* a happy/health page**: http://localhost:5000
* an REST API endpoint: http://localhost:5000/pokemon/charizard  

** On the happy/health page there are also links to the REST API documentation.
